== About this project
This project defines all my infrastructure following the infrastructure as code pattern. It is intended to work specifically on my machines. You might be able to adopt some stuff from this project, but using it "as is" most likly will result in failure.

== How to use this project
This project contains several scripts to control the respective function set. For a complete reference and information on how to use the respective script see xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/index.adoc[].

Be aware that the environment must follow some ground rules:

. Every machine is Ubuntu Linux (or at least Debian-based)
