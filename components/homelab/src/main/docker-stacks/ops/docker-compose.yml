# @file docker-compose.yml
# @brief Run all components needed to allow monitoring a host and management of Docker containers on a host.
#
# @description The ``ops`` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration that manages
# all of the needed exporters to monitor system metrics with Prometheus and Grafana. By
# using the ``ops`` Docker stack, you can quickly and easily deploy all of the necessary
# components for monitoring your system metrics. This includes exporters for various system
# metrics, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network activity.
