The `ops` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration that manages all of the needed exporters to monitor system metrics with Prometheus and Grafana. Additionally, it starts a local Portainer instance. By using the Ops Docker stack, you can quickly and easily deploy all of the necessary components for monitoring your system metrics. This includes exporters for various system metrics, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network activity. The local Portainer instance makes it easy to manage and monitor the Docker containers running in the Ops Docker stack.
