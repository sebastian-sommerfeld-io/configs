All clients (including all RasPi nodes) report their metrics to ``prometheus``. This allows for
centralized collection of metrics from all clients, which can then be analyzed and visualized
using a web-based UI provided by Grafana.

The services listed below are accessible through their respective web UI.

. link:https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from various sources and stores them in a time-series database.
. link:https://grafana.com[Grafana] is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. It provides a web-based UI that allows users to visualize and analyze data from (in this case) Prometheus.

| Container           | URL                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ``prom/prometheus`` | http://monitoring.fritz.box:9090 (prod) |
| ``grafana/grafana`` | http://monitoring.fritz.box:3000 (prod) |

When you start the monitoring stack on your local machine, the same ports are used as in the
production instance and when started will collect data from all configured sources, just as it
does in the production instance. This allows you to test the monitoring stack locally and ensure 
that it is configured correctly before deploying it to production. Additionally, you can use the
local monitoring stack to develop and test new dashboards and alerts before deploying them to the
production environment.
