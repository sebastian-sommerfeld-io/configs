:description: Installation guide for machine 'caprica'

The Raspberry Pi node called "monitoring.fritz.box" serves as the central monitoring hub for all the machines in my homelab. To achieve this, I run a stack of Prometheus and Grafana in Docker.

With Prometheus, I can collect system metrics from all the machines in my homelab, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk utilization, and network traffic. This gives me a comprehensive view of the health and performance of my systems, allowing me to identify and address any issues before they become critical. In addition to system metrics, I have also configured Prometheus to collect data about the up/down status of services running on some machines and on the internet.

To visualize and analyze the data collected by Prometheus, I use Grafana, a powerful tool that allows me to create interactive dashboards. This enables me to quickly identify trends, anomalies, and other patterns in my system data, providing valuable insights into the health and performance of my homelab.
