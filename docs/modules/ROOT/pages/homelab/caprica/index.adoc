:description: Installation guide for machine 'caprica'

Caprica is my primary workstation for all my development tasks and daily to-dos. It runs link:https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop[Ubuntu Desktop]. I have set up Caprica to suit my requirements, installing all necessary tools and development environments. Caprica is heavily reliant on Docker to provide virtually every development tool that I use. By using Docker, I can easily install and manage various development tools without worrying about dependencies or compatibility issues. This allows me to work on multiple projects simultaneously, each with its own set of specific requirements, without having to worry about conflicts.

== Install
=== Ubuntu from bootable USB stick
. Download Ubuntu from the link:https://ubuntu.com[Ubuntu website].
. Create a bootable USB stick from the downloaded iso image with a tool like link:https://www.balena.io/etcher[Etcher] or the Startup Disk Creator (shipped with Ubuntu).
. Install machine from stick (the setup wizard takes care of the hostname, network settings, ssh, ...)
.. When prompted for a user and password, use the username `sebastian` and the default password.
.. Remember to install and activate the OpenSSH server when the wizard prompts for this!
.. Do not install any futher software packages. Installations take place later when provisioning the system with Ansible.
.. Set dark mode, dock config, etc.
.. Add `~/work`, `~/tmp` and `~/virtualmachines` to favorites (in File Manager) and update file associations in "Settings > Applications > Sublime Text"
. Run basic setup tasks using `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/configs/main/components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/install-basics.sh | bash -`
. Test connecting to `caprica` via `ssh sebastian@caprica.fritz.box` (with sebastian being the user created while installing the OS).

=== Configuration and package installation
. Install machine using the ansible configs from this repo (`xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli.sh]`).
. Allow caprica to work with github. Use public key `id_rsa.pub`, NOT the pivate key!

=== Install SSH Server
Setup openssh-server using `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/configs/main/components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/ssh-server.sh | bash -`
