:description: Installation guide for machine 'caprica'

The Raspberry Pi node called "supervisor.fritz.box" is a temporary node to analyze the stability of my monitoring setup. To achieve this, I have installed a stack of Prometheus and Grafana on the supervisor node to monitor my primary Raspberry Pi monitoring node, `xref:homelab/monitoring.fritz.box/index.adoc[]`.

The Prometheus and Grafana stack running on the supervisor node collects data about the health and performance of the monitoring node, including system metrics, service up/down status, and other critical data. This enables me to monitor and analyze the stability of the monitoring node, ensuring that it is running smoothly and efficiently.

If I find that the monitoring node is stable and runs without any crashes or unexpected behavior, I will tear down the supervisor node. However, if I notice any issues or problems with the monitoring node, I can quickly identify and address them using the data collected by the Prometheus and Grafana stack running on the supervisor node.
