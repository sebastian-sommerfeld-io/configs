:model: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
:os: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)

{model} that acts as a custom Github Actions runner. This runner handles GitOps tasks for my homelab and deploys Docker images labeled as release candidate to my local testing RasPi nodes.

== About this Raspberry Pi
This machine is not intended for development purposes so there is no need to push any data to Github. Therefore there is no SSH key configuration for GitHub on this machine. It is only possible to clone public repositories via HTTPS.

== Operating System Setup
Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to install "{os}" onto a SD card. Use the following settings:

image:ROOT:homelab/raspi-imager-settings.png[]

CAUTION: Make sure to enter a valid hostname and user `sebastian` uses the correct password!

== Configuration and package installation
Steps to run on a normal workstation (= a machine with SSH access to the RasPi node which is probably the one used to setup the SD card)

. Enable passwordless SSH connections (from workstation, not the RasPi node)
.. `ssh sebastian@raspi-01.fritz.box`
.. `ssh-copy-id sebastian@raspi-01.fritz.box`
. Apply ansible configs from this repo (`xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli.sh]`)
