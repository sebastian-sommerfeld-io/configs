= switch-display-inputs.sh

Switch display inputs for my Dell monitors from script.

== Overview

This script switches the display inputs for my Dell monitors to
avoid having to use the monitors physical buttons.

The Ansible playbook ensures that this script can be called through the alias

The script is designed to only work on the `caprica` host and fails if
another machine runs this script.

to get information about the screens.
