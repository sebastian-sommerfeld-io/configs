= docker-compose.yml

Docker Compose config to test the Ansible setup of all machines with Chef InSpec.

== Overview

This Docker Compose stack controls all test cases for all machines that
are provisioned and configured with Ansible. The test cases are implemented with Chef
InSpec. Once all Ansible tasks finished successfully the setup is tested with InSpec.
Each InSpec profile is tested on each host in a dedicated container for each combination.

=== Prerequisites

This compose config has been developed and tested with Docker version 24.0.2 on top of
Ubuntu 23.10.

== How to Use

Make sure you use the xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/ansible-cli.sh]
script to provision all machines with Ansible.
