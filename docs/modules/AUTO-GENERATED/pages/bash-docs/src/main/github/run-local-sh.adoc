Wrapper script to apply Github configuration during development from localhost in an easy way.

== Overview

This script is a wrapper script to apply the Github configuration during development
from localhost in an easier way. It provides a menu to select the action of choise and delegates
all commands to `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:bash-docs/src/main/github/apply-config-sh.adoc[apply-config.sh]`
so there is no need to type the whole commands over and over again. These shortcuts are a much
simpler way. Additionally it allows `apply-config.sh` to work the same way from localhost and from a
Github Actions pipeline (both must supply the same params).

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.

=== Script Example

[source, bash]
