Wrapper to use Maven from Docker container when using the default `mvn` command.

== Overview

The script is a wrapper to use Maven from a Docker container when using the default
`mvn` command. The script delegates the Maven commands to a container using image
link:https://hub.docker.com/_/maven[maven].

In order to use the `mvn` command the symlink `/usr/bin/mvn` is added.

The maven installation from inside the container shares its repository with the host. The maven home directory is
located at `$HOME/.m2` on the Docker host.

NOTE: This script is picked up by the ansible-playbook used to provision the `caprica` server node. This way all
systems share the same setup and versions.

CAUTION: To update scripts, adjust files at `~/work/repos/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/configs/src/main/homelab/ansible/assets/scripts/docker/wrappers` and run ansible playbook.
