Command line interface to control all containers from the monitoring stack.

== Overview

This script is designed to start and stop the monitoring Docker stack either on
your local machine (= development environment) or on the respective remote host (= production
environment). The script provides a select menu to choose the environment.

The purpose of this script is to provide a convenient, consistent and repoducible way to manage
the Docker containers for the monitoring stack. With this script, you can quickly set up the
monitoring stack on any given machine for development and production purposes.

All clients (including all RasPi nodes) report their metrics to `prometheus`. This allows for
centralized collection of metrics from all clients, which can then be analyzed and visualized
using a web-based UI provided by Grafana.

However, there is another Prometheus-Grafana stack that will only exist temporarily
(`auditor.fritz.box`). This temporary stack will be set up to monitor the actual
Prometheus-Grafana setup (`monitoring.fritz.box`) to check if the host's resources are
sufficient. This will help ensure that the monitoring stack is running efficiently and that
there are no performance issues. Once the temporary stack has completed its monitoring task,
(i.e. `monitoring.fritz.box` works withput performance issues) it can be taken down to
conserve resources.

|===

. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from various sources and stores them in a time-series database.
. Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. It provides a web-based UI that allows users to visualize and analyze data from (in this case) Prometheus.

=== Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to ensure that Docker and Docker Compose is installed on the
system. The script assumes that the Docker engine is running, and the user has necessary
permissions to execute Docker commands.

=== Script Arguments

The script does not accept any parameters.

== Index

* <<_startup,startup>>
* <<_shutdown,shutdown>>

=== startup

Utility function to startup docker-compose services.

=== shutdown

Utility function to shutdown docker-compose services.
