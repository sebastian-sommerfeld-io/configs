Script to delete undesired files and folders from machine. Script is triggered from cron.

== Overview

Sometimes applications leave traces in the form of files and folders. Virtual machines
running  Windows often leave `System Volume Information` folders behind and IntelliJ leaves some
logfiles behind (among other files and folders). This script deletes these files and folders.
The script is configured as a cronjob and runs regularly.
