Command line interface to control docker-compose services on your local machine.

== Overview

This Bash script that acts as a command line interface to control Docker Compose
services on your local machine. The script provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your
Docker Compose services, allowing you to start, stop, and restart your containers with a few
simple commands. It is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services by providing
a set of convenient and intuitive commands that allow you to control your containers quickly and
easily.

The script auto-detects the services from the filesystem and provides a select menu to
choose a stack. Once you select the stack, the script will provide you with a set of commands to
manage the containers within from the respective Docker Compose definition.

This script is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services on your local
machine. It provides a convenient, consistent and repoducible way to manage the Docker containers
through an easy-to-use interface that allows you to control your containers quickly and
efficiently.

=== Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to ensure that Docker and Docker Compose is installed on the
system. The script assumes that the Docker engine is running, and the user has necessary
permissions to execute Docker commands.

=== Docker Stacks

==== Stack: monitoring.fritz.box

include::ROOT:partial$homelab/services/docker/monitoring-fritz-box.adoc[]

==== Stack: supervisor.fritz.box

There is another Prometheus-Grafana stack that will only exist temporarily
(`supervisor.fritz.box`). This temporary stack will be set up to monitor the actual
Prometheus-Grafana setup (`monitoring.fritz.box`) to check if the host's resources are
sufficient. This will help ensure that the monitoring stack is running efficiently and that
there are no performance issues. Once the temporary stack has completed its monitoring task,
(i.e. `monitoring.fritz.box` works withput performance issues) it can be taken down to
conserve resources.

The services listed below are accessible through their respective web UI.

|===
| Container | URL

| `prom/prometheus`
| http://supervisor.fritz.box:9090 (prod)

| `grafana/grafana`
| http://supervisor.fritz.box:3000 (prod)

==== Stack: ops

The `ops` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration that manages all of the needed exporters
to monitor system metrics with Prometheus and Grafana. Additionally, it starts a local Portainer
instance. By using the Ops Docker stack, you can quickly and easily deploy all of the necessary
components for monitoring your system metrics. This includes exporters for various system metrics,
such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network activity. The local Portainer instance makes it easy to
manage and monitor the Docker containers running in the Ops Docker stack.

==== Stack: sommerfeld-io

The `sommerfeld-io` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration for the website
https://www.sommerfeld.io. This Docker Compose configuration is used to start the website locally
in a Docker container.

==== Stack: websites

The `websites` Docker stack is a Docker Compose configuration for the websites
https://www.masterblender.de, https://www.tafelbox.de and https://www.numero-uno.de. This Docker
Compose configuration is used to start these websites locally in Docker containers.
