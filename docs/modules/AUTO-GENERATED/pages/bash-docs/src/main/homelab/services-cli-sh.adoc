Command line interface to control docker-compose services on your local machine.

== Overview

This Bash script that acts as a command line interface to control Docker Compose
services on your local machine. The script provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your
Docker Compose services, allowing you to start, stop, and restart your containers with a few
simple commands. It is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services by providing
a set of convenient and intuitive commands that allow you to control your containers quickly and
easily.

The script auto-detects the services from the filesystem and provides a select menu to
choose a stack. Once you select the stack, the script will provide you with a set of commands to
manage the containers within from the respective Docker Compose definition.

This script is intended to simplify the management of Docker Compose services on your local
machine. It provides a convenient, consistent and repoducible way to manage the Docker containers
through an easy-to-use interface that allows you to control your containers quickly and
efficiently.

=== Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to ensure that Docker and Docker Compose is installed on the
system. The script assumes that the Docker engine is running, and the user has necessary
permissions to execute Docker commands.

=== Docker Stacks

==== monitoring.fritz.box

All clients (including all RasPi nodes) report their metrics to `prometheus`. This allows for
centralized collection of metrics from all clients, which can then be analyzed and visualized
using a web-based UI provided by Grafana.

However, there is another Prometheus-Grafana stack that will only exist temporarily
(`supervisor.fritz.box`). This temporary stack will be set up to monitor the actual
Prometheus-Grafana setup (`monitoring.fritz.box`) to check if the host's resources are
sufficient. This will help ensure that the monitoring stack is running efficiently and that
there are no performance issues. Once the temporary stack has completed its monitoring task,
(i.e. `monitoring.fritz.box` works withput performance issues) it can be taken down to
conserve resources.

The services listed below are accessible through their respective web UI.

. link:https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from various sources and stores them in a time-series database.
. link:https://grafana.com[Grafana] is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. It provides a web-based UI that allows users to visualize and analyze data from (in this case) Prometheus.

| `prom/prometheus`
| http://monitoring.fritz.box:9090 (prod)

| `grafana/grafana`
| http://monitoring.fritz.box:3000 (prod)
|===

When you start the monitoring stack on your local machine, the same ports are used as in the
production instance and when started will collect data from all configured sources, just as it
does in the production instance. This allows you to test the monitoring stack locally and ensure
that it is configured correctly before deploying it to production. Additionally, you can use the
local monitoring stack to develop and test new dashboards and alerts before deploying them to the
production environment.
