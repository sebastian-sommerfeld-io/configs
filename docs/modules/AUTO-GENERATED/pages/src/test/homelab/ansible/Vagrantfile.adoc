= Vagrantfile

Please describe me better ... TODO

== Overview

This Vagrantfile represents a virtual machine which is used to
test the Ansible playbooks which install my physical Ubuntu Desktop machines
in my homelab.

By running the same playbooks inside this Vagrantbox it is testable whether
an installation-run would fail (for some reason) and whether the Ansible
Config works with newer versions of Ubuntu.

CAUTION: Still work in progress
