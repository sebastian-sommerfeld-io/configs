= python.sh

Wrapper to use Python from Docker container when using the `py` command.

== Overview

The script is a wrapper to use Python from a Docker container when using the `py`
command. The script delegates the all tasks to the Python runtime inside a container using image
link:https://hub.docker.com/_/python[python].

CAUTION: Since Ubuntu comes with a pre-installed python, the `python`, `python3` and `python3.9`
commands are already allocated. To make sure only custom developments use this script, the `py`
command is introduced.

In order to use the `py` command (not `python`) the symlink `/usr/bin/py` is added.

CAUTION: To update scripts, adjust files at `~/work/repos/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/configs/src/main/homelab/ansible/assets/scripts/docker/wrappers` and run ansible playbook.
