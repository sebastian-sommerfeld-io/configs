This Docker Compose configuration represents the comprehensive monitoring stack for the homelab environment.

== Overview

This Docker Compose configuration represents the comprehensive monitoring
stack for the homelab environment.

The monitoring stack is designed to gather data from all nodes and workstations in the
homelab environment. This means that metrics related to system performance, network
usage, application behavior, and other relevant data are collected from every host
in the homelab.

Once the monitoring stack collects the data, it is processed and made available through
dashboards.

== Runtime Environment

The entire monitoring stack is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi node named
`monitoring.fritz.box`. This means that the Raspberry Pi serves as the central hub for
your monitoring infrastructure.

== Components of the Monitoring Stack

|===
| Component | Port | URL | Info

| Prometheus
| 9090
| http://localhost:9100

| Grafana
| 3000
| http://localhost:9110

| http://localhost
| Reverse Proxy
|===

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and
scalability. In this stack, Prometheus serves as the core component responsible for
collecting and storing metrics from various sources in the homelab, including nodes and
workstations.

Grafana is a popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides a
powerful interface for creating interactive and customizable dashboards. Grafana integrates
seamlessly with Prometheus, allowing you to visualize the data collected by Prometheus in
the form of graphs, charts, and alerts.

Apart from Prometheus and Grafana, this stack includes other containers responsible for
additional tasks like routing all HTTP requests to a Component through a reverse proxy.

== Benefits

By deploying this monitoring stack, valuable insights into the performance and behavior of
the homelab infrastructure are gained. It allows to identify issues, optimize resource usage,
and ensure the overall stability of all systems. Additionally, having centralized dashboards
makes it easier to track trends over time and respond proactively to any anomalies or
problems that might arise within your homelab.

In summary, this Docker Compose configuration sets up a robust monitoring stack. This stack
collects data from all nodes and workstations in your homelab, processes the information,
and presents it through customizable dashboards, enhancing the ability to monitor and manage
the homelab environment effectively.
