Run portainer with a default configuration.

== Overview

This `portainer` Docker stack starts a link:https://github.com/portainer/portainer[Portainer CE]
instance. This link:https://docs.portainer.io[Portainer] instance is pre-configured with an
admin user and handles deployments of other Docker stacks through GitOps techniques.

Additionally a `postman/newman` container is started to initialize portainer with all relevant
settings. This container runs a Postman collection that sets up all Docker stacks (among other
things) and runs some tests on the portainer instance. This container is terminated after the
collecetion run ended.
